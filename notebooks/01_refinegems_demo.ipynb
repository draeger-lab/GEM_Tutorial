    "## Getting Data and Loading a GEM\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the year, many genome-scale metabolic models have been published, many of which remain in the supplementals of their corresponding paper. However, there are two main databases for models of this type, [BioModels](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/) and [BiGG Models](http://bigg.ucsd.edu). In the context of this notebook, we will use a model from the BiGG Models database with the identifier [`iJN1463`](http://bigg.ucsd.edu/models/iJN1463).\n",
    "\n",
    "`iJN1463` is a model for *Pseudomonas putida* KT2440, a pollutant degrative bacteria, pushing it into the focus of industrial biotechnology [^1]. \n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned in the slides, there are two main libraries, COBRApy[^2] and libSBML[^3], for loading models. Each has their own object type for the GEMs, both with their own adcantages and disadvantages. Since this notebook is about the basics and information extraction, it will focus on the COBRApy model object, as information extraction is easier on that object type.\n",
    "\n",
    "üìù **Task**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download the model with the accession number `iJN1463` from BiGG Models using, e.g. the package `requests`.\n",
    "2. Load the model with `refineGEMs` as a COBRApy model in a variable called `cobramodel`.\n",
